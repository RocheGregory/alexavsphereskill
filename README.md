# Amazon Alexa vSphere Skill Using Flask-ASK and VMware REST API's 
TheHumbleLab (https://www.thehumblelab.com) Blog Walkthrough of building an Alexa Skill to interface with VMware REST API's

This is the GitHub Repository for my Amazon Echo, Python Flask/Flask-ASK, and VMware API's blogpost and subsequent updates. 

We leverage Flask-Ask to interact with the Amazon Skills platform and build rest API communication from python. As the blog posts are updated, new code will be pushed into this repository to match the pace of the blog.
